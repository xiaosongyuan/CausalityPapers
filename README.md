# CausalityPapers
A list of causal extraction and causal inference papers

**Causal extraction(CE):** Extract entities or events which are of a causality from the same texts, the type of texts can be sentence or paragraph.

**Causal inference(CI):** It's a process of determining the independent, actual effect of a particular phenomenon that is a component of a larger system.
